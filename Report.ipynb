        "# ***Stanford vs Harvard University***\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction:\n",
        "Suppose that a person applied to study for Stanford University and Harvard University. Then he/she accepted by both of them. Since they are one of the best university, he/she felt confused. On the other hand, art and entertainment venues around the university are vital for him/her.\n",
        "## Data:\n",
        "In order to solve this problem, I google the address of universities and retrieve their geographical coordinates via geolocater library. After that, I use Foursquare API to collect data of art and entertainment venues around both universities.\n",
        "## Methodology:\n",
        "I find the venue category from this link: https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories. Itâ€™s very useful. So, I convert this data to panda dataframes.\n",
        "## Analysis:\n",
        "By using the folium map library, I pinpoint venues for both universities. Also, I demonstrate categories by grouping them via the bar plot.\n",
        "For further analyzing, I apply one-hot encoding and k-means clusters for the dataframes. Next, I create a folium map for the clusters.\n",
        "As comparing venues for both universities, I merge category columns of dataframes. Afterward, I note similarity and dissimilarity between them along with the grouped bar pilot.\n",
        "## Results:\n",
        "To sum up, Stanford University has more venues and different kinds of venues than Harvard University.\n",
        "Conclusion:\n",
        "Since art and entertainment venues are very important for him/her and Stanford University has more art and entertainment venues, he/she would prefer Stanford University.\n",
        " \n",
        "## Limitations:\n",
        "- I just use the Foursquare API to collect data.\n",
        "- The comparison is just based on art and entertainment venues.\n"
